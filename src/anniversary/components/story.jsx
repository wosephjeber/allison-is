    Happy {{occasion1}}!
  </h1>

  <p class="mb-2">
    Can you believe it? We've been {{adjective1}} for 5 years! Those years have flown by.
    I {{adverb1}} remember this day 5 years ago. We had put in so much work in the preceding
    months, and on that day all that work paid off and we were able to just {{verb1}} it.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-2">
    Marrying you was the {{superlativeAdjective1}} decision I've made. I've loved making a {{noun1}},
    learning to {{verb2}}, exploring new {{pluralNoun1}} in our cities, {{gerund1}} the world,
    and pretty much doing everything with you. Along the way you've taught me a lot about
    {{noun2}} and pushed me to become a {{adjective3}} person.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-2">
    I've watched you take on new {{pluralNoun2}} and take big {{pluralNoun3}} (such as leaving
    your job and embarking on the current adventure of {{noun3}} and building a {{noun4}}).
    I know it hasn't always been easy, but I'm so proud of you.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-2">
    I can't wait for the next 5 {{pluralNoun4}} (and then the 5 {{pluralNoun4}} after that, and the
    5 {{pluralNoun4}} after that, and so on). I don't know where life is going to take us,
    but I'm so thankful {{properNoun1}} has brought us together so that you'll be by my side.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love you!
    <br />
