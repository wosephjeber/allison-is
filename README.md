# allison.is

## What is this?

A "business card" site for my wife. Sort of serious, sort of a joke. We bought
the domain, I had an idea for an interface, and here we are.

## Getting started

### Development

To run the project locally, first install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Then you can start a dev server with:

```
yarn start
```

### Deployment

This isn't ready for deployment yet, but when it is you'll find instructions
here.
